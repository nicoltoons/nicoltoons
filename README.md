## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm âœ¨Anthonia Nicol. I am a Game Developer, 2D Animator and Illustrator. For game development, I use C#, JSON, MySQL and PHP to create my games and databases. I use Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator and Animate for animations and illustrations however, I adapt to whatever software is required for the job.
Off my regular routine, I enjoy :
Creative Writing for books and blogs.
âš¡Learning new coding languages; especially those that compliment the languages I currently use.
Watching and dissecting movies.
